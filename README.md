Visit GETTINGSTARTED.md if you are a contributor.

I've also written TUTORIAL.md for beginner programmers who want to create their first fullstack project using Python!

PS:  It's a demonstration right now because I plan on turning it to an actual platform, which is not possible with the current free tier cloud hosting and database. Follow me to get notified when I release it!
